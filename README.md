Hi, this is a project where I created an Uber Clone using Next JS, React JS, Tailwind CSS and Firebase.

## To Run this clone locally:

First, download the files and open the file location in a terminal (preferebly WSL). Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
